## About this Specialization

This specialization is intended for application developers, system administrators and architects seeking to develop their understanding of container technology.  In this three-course specialization, you will explore a range of foundational concepts from various use cases for containerized technology to understanding the differences between Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift to learning how to scale deployed applications.

These courses include detailed hands-on exercises (step-by-step guides) which teach a range of concepts from the foundation concepts of containerized applications to deploying containerized applications to Kubernetes and OpenShift. After completing this specialization, you should have a foundational understanding of how to develop, deploy, scale and troubleshoot containerized applications to Kubernetes and OpenShift.

## Courses

### 1. Foundations of Red Hat Cloud-Native Development

Foundations of Red Hat Cloud-native Development (DO100a) is designed for IT professionals without previous cloud application deployment experience to learn basic Kubernetes skills. This course is part of a three-course specialization. In this specialization, you will run, deploy, and test containerized applications with zero-downtime releases.

### 2. Managing Cloud-Native Applications with Kubernetes

Managing Cloud-native Applications with Kubernetes (DO100b) is designed for IT professionals without previous cloud application deployment experience to learn basic Kubernetes skills. This course is the second course of a three-course specialization. In this specialization, you will run, deploy, and test containerized applications with zero-downtime releases.

### 3. Advanced Application Management with Red Hat Openshift

This course explores the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) as a container orchestration platform. In this course, students will deploy applications to OpenShift. Students will learn how to let RHOCP containerize their source code, how to scale the deployments, and how to troubleshoot issues with the deployments.
